College instructor, digital media designer, and developing developer. Technology is my mainstay. 

As my work has increasingly employed technology, I began to self-learn coding and software engineering. As it became more central to my work, I studied it via software engineering programs in Manhattan. 

Here you will find my work as a developing developer, and beyond. 

My formal education includes an M.A.in Rhetoric and a B.A. Digital Media.
