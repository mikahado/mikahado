College instructor, digital media designer, and now a developing developer. Technology is my mainstay. Whether its financial systems to healthcare dataset, from organization to social networks and art, I'm the medium -- the software developer, the old town square where commerce meets creative, where the individual meets the social sphere. I'm not either one, I'm the medium.

As my work has increasingly employed technology, I began to self-learn coding and software engineering. As it became more central to my work, I studied it via an immersive program in Manhattan. 

Here you will find my work as a developing developer, and beyond. 

My formal education includes an M.A.
