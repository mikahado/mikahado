For the past 10 years, I have been a college instructor and a digital media designer. As my work has increasingly employed technology, I began to self-learn coding and software engineering skills a few years ago, to improve the functionality of my work. 
My interest in these field have grown, and Iâ€™ve decided to make a career change into software development. 
My formal education concludes with an M.A., focusing in language arts, rhetoric/logic, as well as literary and information theory.
